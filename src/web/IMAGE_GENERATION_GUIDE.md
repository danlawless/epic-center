## Image Generation Tips

### For Best Results:
1. Use `--style raw` in Midjourney for more photographic results
2. Add `--no text, words, letters, watermark` to avoid unwanted text
3. Use `--q 2` for higher quality outputs
4. Reference specific camera models for different feels (e.g., "shot on Sony A7III")
5. Specify "editorial photography" or "architectural photography" for professional feel
6. Always include lighting descriptors: "soft natural light," "golden hour," "diffused daylight"

### Color Consistency:
- Reference specific hex codes in prompts when possible
- Use terms: "warm earth tones," "forest green," "golden accents," "cream white"
- Avoid: blue-tinted images, cold lighting, high contrast

### Style Consistency:
- Maintain "luxury wellness" aesthetic throughout
- Balance medical credibility with warmth
- Avoid stock photo clichés (forced smiles, arms crossed, fake enthusiasm)
- Show real, authentic moments
