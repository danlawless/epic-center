# Pillar 7: Pre-Care and Post-Care

> *The full arc of transformation*

---

## The Continuum of Care

A retreat is not an event - it is a phase within a longer arc of transformation. Without proper preparation, guests arrive unprepared. Without proper integration, insights fade. The retreat itself is perhaps 10% of the transformation; the other 90% happens before and after.
