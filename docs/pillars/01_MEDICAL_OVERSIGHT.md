# Pillar 1: Medical and Scientific Oversight

> *Evidence-based care protecting the sacred journey*

---

## Purpose

Medical and scientific oversight is the foundation upon which all other pillars rest. Without rigorous medical protocols, we cannot ensure guest safety. Without measurable outcomes, we cannot claim transformation. Without evidence-based practices, we cannot build credibility.

This pillar exists to:
1. **Protect guests** from preventable medical complications
2. **Screen appropriately** for contraindications and risks
3. **Monitor continuously** during vulnerable phases
4. **Measure outcomes** to prove and improve our work
5. **Build credibility** through scientific rigor
