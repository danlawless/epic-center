# Pillar 2: Plant Medicine (Iboga & Ibogaine)

> *The medicine is a catalyst, not the destination*

---

## Sacred Context

Plant medicines have been used for thousands of years by indigenous cultures for healing, spiritual awakening, and rites of passage. Iboga, specifically, is the sacred sacrament of the Bwiti tradition of Central Africa.

At Transformational Epicenter, we approach plant medicine with:
- **Deep reverence** for the medicine and its origins
- **Medical rigor** to ensure safety
- **Therapeutic containment** to support the process
- **Integration focus** because the medicine is just the beginning

We are not a "ceremony mill" or quick-fix solution. We use medicine as a catalyst within a comprehensive healing framework.

## The Medicine: Iboga & Ibogaine

### Ibogaine Overview

**What It Is**
Ibogaine is the primary psychoactive alkaloid found in the root bark of the Iboga plant (Tabernanthe iboga), native to Central Africa.

**Mechanisms of Action**
- NMDA receptor modulation
- Serotonin system interaction
- Opioid receptor resetting
- Dopamine pathway influence
- Neuroplasticity enhancement

**Therapeutic Applications**
- Trauma resolution
- Addiction interruption (opioids especially)
- Depression and anxiety
- PTSD
- Existential and spiritual exploration

**Duration**
- Onset: 30-90 minutes
- Peak: 4-8 hours
- Total duration: 24-36 hours
- Integration phase: 24-72 hours post-ceremony

### Forms Used

| Form | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Total Alkaloid Extract (TA) | Full spectrum of alkaloids | Preferred for depth |
| Ibogaine HCl | Isolated ibogaine hydrochloride | Medical precision |
| Root Bark | Traditional form | Selected traditional contexts |

### Dosing Principles

**General Approach**
- Weight-based dosing calculation
- Consider individual metabolism
- Cardiac safety primary concern
- Therapeutic effect secondary to safety

**Dose Ranges (Ibogaine HCl)**
| Level | Dose | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Test | 25-50mg | Sensitivity check |
| Flood | 10-20mg/kg | Full experience |
| Booster | 50-100mg | Extend/deepen (if needed) |

*Exact protocols developed with medical team*
