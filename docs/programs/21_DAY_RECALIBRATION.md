# 21-Day Deep Recalibration

> *Three weeks for comprehensive transformation*

---

## Overview

The 21-Day program provides the optimal duration for deep transformation. Three weeks allows the nervous system to truly reset, patterns to begin shifting, and new ways of being to emerge before returning home.

**Duration**: 21 days / 20 nights
**Ceremonies**: 1-2 (based on assessment)
**Post-Care**: 9 months standard

---

## The 21-Day Principle

Research on habit formation and neuroplasticity supports the 21-day period:
- Sufficient time for nervous system recalibration
- New neural pathways begin forming
- Old patterns begin releasing
- Integration becomes embodied
- Identity shifts can stabilize

---
